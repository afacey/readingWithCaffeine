## Project Description

The client is an avid reader who regularly takes out books from their local public library. However, they are finding it difficult to read in peace at home, so would like to be able to locate a coffee shop close to their library. They would like to be able to pick up their book and then stroll to the nearest cafe.

## Tools used

React, HTML, CSS, Mapquest API

## Requirements

* Mapquest API
* The user should first be able to search for their public library
* After selecting the library, they should be able to specify the distance (since sometimes they bike but sometimes they drive)
* The app will then return a list of results of Coffee Shops in the area
* The user can select a coffee shop and be given directions to that location from the library
* Proper error handling.
